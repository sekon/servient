Hello,
Thank you for your interest in servient. Hope you find it useful.
I have tried to keep it as standards compliant as possible. At the very least
you need a POSIX shell with jobcontrol, which supports redirection.
I have tested this code primarily on the following Unix shells
(a) Bash 4.1-3
(b) Dash 0.5.5.1-7.4
(c) ash shipped with busybox-1.12.4.

Busybox was compiled with the following flags while testing:
(a) ASH_BASH_COMPAT [=n] 
(b) ASH_JOB_CONTROL [=y]
(c) ASH_READ_NCHARS [=y]  
(d) ASH_READ_TIMEOUT [=y]
(e) ASH_ALIAS [=n]
(f) ASH_MATH_SUPPORT [=y]
(g) ASH_MATH_SUPPORT_64 [=n]
(h) ASH_GETOPTS [=y]
(i) ASH_BUILTIN_ECHO [=y]
(j) ASH_BUILTIN_PRINTF [=y]
(k) ASH_BUILTIN_TEST [=y]
(l) ASH_CMDCMD [=y]
(m) ASH_MAIL [=n]
(n) ASH_OPTIMIZE_FOR_SIZE [=y]
(o) ASH_RANDOM_SUPPORT [=y]
(p) ASH_EXPAND_PRMT [=n]
(q) HUSH [=n]
(r) LASH [=n]
(s) MSH [=n]
(t) FEATURE_SH_EXTRA_QUIET [=y]
(u) CTTYHACK [=n]
(v) STATIC [=y]

While compiling the version of busybox stated above if you get an error
along the lines of redefinition of struct flock in miscutils/inotifyd.c, then
either
(a) Disable inotify in busybox
*OR*
(b) If "sys/inotify.h" exists on your system replace the text
#include <linux/inotify.h> in the file miscutils/inotifyd.c with 
#include <sys/inotify.h>.

Given below is a list of needed binaries to be present in the operating
environment:
	cd
	ls
	rm
	id
	grep
	wc
	ps
	awk
	sed
	expr
	cut 
	find


Thank you for your interest in servient. Hope it was of some help to you.
Please do write back with Feedback, suggestions, flames or anything of that

			Frequently asked questions:
1)What is servient ??
servient aims to be a small, simple, flexible and light weight black box unit
testing framework.

2)What is so unique about servient ??
It aims to be a pluggable way to primitively validate scripts written in
multiple languages (both compiled and interpreted).

3)What is/are the use case(s) servient aims to target ??
Currently,
Suppose you are an instructor in a class and have to validate scripts of "n"
students, for a question paper containing "m" questions in one go.

4)You say validation .. could you elaborate ??
Instructor provides a reference script for each of the "m" questions, that a
student could attempt to answer along with test cases to validate student
scripts.

5)What about security ??
There are *NO* security features in place, you have to take necessary
precautions (like running in a chroot with fine grained access control
/running in a throwable VM)

6)So a validated script is guaranteed to be correct ??
No, it is entirely dependent on the instructor provided reference script along
with coverage of the test case(s), which are also optional.

7)AHHHH .. the lines look weird ??
Set text width to 79 and set text wrap on (which is on by default).
If you are using vim,
set tw=79
set wrap

8) Anything else ??

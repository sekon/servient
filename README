Frequently asked questions:
1)What is servient ??
servient aims to be a small, simple and flexible black box unit testing framework.

2)What is so unique about servient ??
It aims to be a pluggable way to validate scripts written in multiple
languages (both compiled and interpreted).

3)What is the use case servient aims to target ??
Suppose you are an instructor in a lab and have to validate scripts of "n" 
students, for a question paper containing "m" questions in one go.

4)You say validation .. could you eloberate ??
Instuctor provides a reference script for each of the "m" questions, that a
student could attempt to answer along with test cases to validate student
scripts.

5)What about security ??
There are very few security features in place, you have to take necessary
precautions (like running in a chroot with fine grained access control
perhaps ??)

6)So a validated script is guarenteed to be correct ??
No, it is entirely dependent on the instructor provided reference script along
with coverage of the test case(s), which are also optional.

7) Anything else ??
